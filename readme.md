# eInk Smart Device

Crafted a simple device that shows daily motivational images. This is my first hardware project ever, and I wanted to create something practical and useful. Below are the details and products I used for this project: 

For more details refer to: https://hackaday.io/project/163812-e-ink-motivational-book 

The hardware used was: 

1. Pi Zero W (I bought it used from ebay: ~8 USD)  
2. e-Ink Display (~45 USD)  
3. Office Depot Battery (~2 USD) 
4. Wooden Structure (Got few items from Michael's and a closed friend helped me design it: ~10 USD) 

Software: 

1. NodeJS (Backend) 
2. SQLite (DB) 
3. Bootstrap (Frontend) 

Every day at 7:00 AM (EST) the device will pull fresh motivational images from Reddit/Imgur. The device will show each image every 5 minutes. The web application allows you to review, reload or delete images. It also serves as a dashboard to list the total images for the day.
